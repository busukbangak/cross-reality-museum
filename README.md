## About

Prototype of a gamified virtual museum tour in WebVR to learn about a prehistoric whale. The experience is based on real exhibits from the Museum for Nature and Environment in Lübeck. I designed and implemented the complete user flow and movement system, and integrated all 3D models and audio assets.

This project was created as part of a Cross Reality module at Universität zu Lübeck.

## Features

- Interactive whale skeleton exhibit with multiple bone parts
